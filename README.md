# CryptoAlgo

This program allows you to encrypt messages and keys using the RSA and AES algorithms. The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt the AES keys, which is then transmitted to the receiver.
I think this is my shortest Readme to date, short and sweet!

## Inner workings
Please visit my website at <https://www.cryptoalgo.cf> or email me at <support@cryptoalgo.cf> to find out more!

## Compile it yourself...

```bash
pkg .
```

## Or even better: download the latest stable or beta version from GitHub releases!
## Would you like to give me feedback and run exclusive insider Beta and Alpha groups?
You can join my Telegram Channel at <https://t.me/CryptoAlgorithm> to give me feedback on CryptoAlgo releases or UX improvements.
