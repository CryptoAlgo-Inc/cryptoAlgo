Time Zone Database<br /><br /><br />      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone<br />    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database<br />    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone<br />    Database section 7.<br /><br /><br />     # 7.  Database Ownership<br />     #<br />     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF<br />     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work<br />     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the<br />     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do<br />     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make<br />     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ<br />     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA<br />     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of<br />     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance<br />     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made<br />     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person<br />     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to<br />     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.<br /><br /><br />    6.

Such instructions must be<br />    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any<br />    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you<br />    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.<br />    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty<br />    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then<br />    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.<br /><br /><br />    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without<br />    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to<br />    the Source of the Modified Version.<br /><br /><br />    Aggregating or Linking the Package<br /><br /><br />    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or<br />    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting<br />    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the<br />    Package.

In addition, such works are not<br />    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the<br />    terms of this license.<br /><br /><br />    General Provisions<br /><br /><br />    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or<br />    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License.
